# PathFinding-Using-parallelization
This is an academic project that was done in December, 2018.  The goal was to parallelize all possible loops without invoking race conditions using unity's new job system.
To that end, this project is still a work in progress as it still can be parallelized at a lot more junctions.
The algorithm used for pathfinding was Bellman Ford, which is an ideal algorithm for parallelization.
